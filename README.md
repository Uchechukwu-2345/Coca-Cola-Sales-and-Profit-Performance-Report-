### 7.Key Findings and Insights
-**Retailers’ Contribution**
The analysis reveals that Walmart dominates Coca-Cola’s retail market, generating $4.40 million in total sales, which exceeds the combined total of the other retailers — Target ($404.41K), Costco ($1.29M), and CVS ($2.12M). This suggests that Walmart holds a substantial market share, possibly due to its expansive distribution network, competitive pricing, or long-standing consumer loyalty.
- **Regional Performance**

  Among the four operational regions, the West region leads in profit generation, followed closely by the Southeast. Conversely, the Midwest region records the lowest profit, with the West generating over 181% more profit than the 
  Midwest. This disparity highlights untapped growth opportunities in underperforming regions.
- **Beverage Brand Performance**
  
Coca-Cola remains the top-selling beverage, with 3,989,000 units sold, followed by Dasani Water at 2,890,500 units. Powerade lags behind with 2,042,500 units sold. This reflects consumer preference trends and brand performance disparities within the portfolio.

- **Delivery Efficiency**
  
FedEx outperforms DHL in delivery efficiency, averaging 36.9 days per delivery compared to DHL’s 37.2 days. Though the difference is minimal, it still indicates FedEx’s relative operational advantage.

-** Annual Sales and Profit Trend**
  
Sales and profits peak in December ($984.7K in sales, $366.3K in profit), likely driven by festive season demand. Notably, there’s a significant decline from July ($969.6K) to October ($595.3K), while May to August maintains strong performance, suggesting a clear seasonal sales pattern.

### 8.Data-Driven Recommendations
**- Strengthen Partnerships with Walmart**
  
Given Walmart’s commanding market share, Coca-Cola should consider exclusive product launches, promotional deals, or loyalty incentives with Walmart to solidify this profitable relationship and potentially replicate this success model with other major retailers.

**- Invest in Regional Market Development**

Focus marketing and distribution resources on Midwest and other underperforming regions through targeted promotions, local sponsorships, and retail partnerships to unlock untapped revenue potential.

**- Enhance Brand Promotion for Powerade**
  
With Powerade underperforming in unit sales, Coca-Cola should reevaluate its pricing, promotional strategies, and market positioning for the brand to boost its competitiveness and consumer appeal.

**- Optimize Logistics Partnerships**

Although FedEx currently leads in delivery efficiency, Coca-Cola should explore operational improvement opportunities with DHL and other delivery partners, possibly through performance-based incentives or collaborative process reviews to enhance overall supply chain reliability.

**- Capitalize on Seasonal Sales Trends**
  
Leverage the December and May-August peak seasons by planning inventory, promotional campaigns, and targeted advertising in advance. Additionally, develop strategies to mitigate the mid-year slump (July-October) with special offers, limited-time products, or regional events.
